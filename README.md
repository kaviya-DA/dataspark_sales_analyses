Daraspark: Eliminating Insights for Global Electronics

Project Overview:
This project analyzes global electronics sales data to identify trends and strategies to increase sales and profitability. Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, I explored key business insights for stakeholders.
Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas for data cleaning and merging)
MySQL (SQL queries for analysis)
Power BI (Data visualization and dashboards)

Dataset Overview:
Order Details (Order Number, Order Date, Delivery Date, Product, Quantity, Price)
Customer Information (Name, Gender, Location, Birthday)
Store Details (Store Key, Square Meters, Open Date)
Product Data (Product Name, Brand, Category, Color, Price)

Key Insights and Visualizations:
1. Total Sales Analysis → (Bar Chart: Year vs. Total Sales)
2. Top 10 Selling Products → (Sorted Bar Chart)
3. Profitability Analysis → (Line Chart: Unit Cost vs. Unit Price)
4. Customer Demographics → (Pie Chart: Gender Distribution)
5. Sales by Location → (Map Visualization)
6. Store Performance → (KPIs for high-performing stores)

Project Goals:
Identify trends in electronics sales.
Analyze factors affecting profitability.
Provide recommendations for sales growth.

How to Use the Files:
Python scripts (data_cleaning.py, data_merging.py) → Data preparation
SQL scripts (analysis_queries.sql) → Query execution
Power BI dashboard (sales_dashboard.pbix) → Interactive visualizations

Next Steps:
Improve predictions with machine learning.
Expand analysis with customer segmentation.
